# homelab

This is to be my centralized git repository which will act as my single source of truth as I declaritively provision and manage the many moving pieces of my home infrastructure and labs.

I'm currently migrating some containerized services from legacy hardware onto a vm. 

As well as, configuring and hardening my hypervisor host (proxmox) in preparation of running my own personal kubernetes cluster.
