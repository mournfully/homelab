# homelab

This is to be my centralized git repository which will act as my single source of truth as I declaritively provision and manage the many moving pieces of my home infrastructure and labs.

I'm currently configuring and hardening my hypervisor host (proxmox) in preparation of running my own personal kubernetes cluster. As well as, migrating some containerized services from some legacy hardware onto a vm. All the while, trying to figure out how *ansible* and *proper git commits* might fit into the picture.
